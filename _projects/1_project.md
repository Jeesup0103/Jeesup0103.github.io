<h3>Deeplant</h3>

A food tech company which innovates the meat industry.

Developed models to predict meat grade and tastes using deep learning.

Implemented machine learning models for predicting meat grade and tastes using CNN and ViT.

Achieved a 98% accuracy in classifying meat grades using convolutional neural network.

Improved the prediction performance of meat taste from around 50% to average accuracy of 65% by taking various feature engineering with transfomer-based model, ViT.
